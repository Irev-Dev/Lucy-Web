### Notice
Not maintained! Here's the back story. I started this project as way to mix a currenty hobby of racing quads and my new found love of OpenSCAD. As part of developing it I ran into frustrations with not being able to easly add fillets in OpenSCAD and so developed the [Round-Anything](https://github.com/Irev-Dev/Round-Anything) library to support this project. Some life events resulted in putting the project down and it lost steam.

My original [landing page](https://lucy-quad.kurthutten.com/) for lucy is still up in a graveyard state. and the [teaser video can be found here](https://vimeo.com/238244710).

The quad itself is in [this repo](https://github.com/Irev-Dev/Lucy).

# [LucyKwad.io](https://lucy-quad.kurthutten.com/)

This is code for the Lucy Kwad landing page, built using the following:

- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB
- PUG templating
- Parcel bundler
- ESlint
